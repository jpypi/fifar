An initial excursion in convolutional neural nets using tensorflow.

We try our hand at cifar-10 to practice using tensorflow with 2d convolutions
before heading to our other project which will make use of 3d convolutions.

Based losely off various papers and for experimentation and furthering of
intuition.
